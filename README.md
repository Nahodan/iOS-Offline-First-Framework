Overview
The iOS Offline-First Framework tackles a common problem in mobile apps: data integrity and user experience when the network is flaky or unavailable. It delivers a cohesive set of components that work together to store data locally, synchronize with a remote backend when possible, resolve conflicts deterministically, and log analytics events without requiring an always-on connection.

Key goals include:
- Local-first data storage with strong consistency guarantees for the userâ€™s current session.
- Reliable data synchronization across devices and platforms, with predictable conflict handling.
- Rich offline analytics for user behavior, feature usage, and performance metrics.
- Clean, testable architecture that aligns with SOLID principles and modern Swift best practices.
- Flexible integration with Swift Package Manager, Xcode projects, and potential binary releases for performance-critical paths.

Core Concepts
- Offline-First: The local data store is the primary source of truth when the device is offline. Synchronization occurs when connectivity returns.
- Synchronization: A bidirectional process that merges local changes with server state. The framework provides hooks for custom backends and conflict resolution strategies.
- Conflict Resolution: Deterministic rules determine how to merge divergent changes when two sources update the same record concurrently.
- Analytics: Events generated while offline are stored locally and uploaded once the device regains connectivity.
- Observability: The framework exposes observable streams and hooks to monitor sync status, conflicts, and analytics metrics.

Architecture and Design
- Clean Architecture: Separation of concerns across layers. The domain model, use cases, and business rules live in a stable core, decoupled from UI and network specifics.
- Layered Structure:
  - Domain Layer: Core business rules, entity definitions, and domain services.
  - Data Layer: Local stores, remote adapters, and synchronization logic.
  - Interface Adapters: Repositories and gateways that translate between domain and data layers.
  - Presentation Layer: View models and UI logic that observe domain events.
- SOLID Principles: Each component has a single responsibility, is open for extension and closed for modification, and is easy to test in isolation.
- Protocol-Oriented: The framework relies on protocols to allow swapping implementations for storage, network state, and backends.
- Reactive and Async Patterns: Uses Combine or async/await patterns to model asynchronous flows and event streams.
- Platform Focus: iOS, with clear boundaries for Swift Package Manager integration and potential for binary distributions where needed.

Getting Started
This framework is designed for teams who want a robust offline-first strategy with minimal boilerplate. It provides a clear path from local storage to remote synchronization, with optional analytics and strong conflict handling.

Prerequisites
- Xcode 14 or newer
- iOS 13+ minimum deployment target
- Swift 5.7+ (or newer, depending on your Xcode version)
- Swift Package Manager (default in Xcode)
- Optional: Core Data (if you plan to use Core Data-backed stores)

What you will learn
- How to set up a local store for your domain entities.
- How to configure a sync engine that talks to your backend.
- How to implement conflict resolution strategies that fit your appâ€™s semantics.
- How to collect and analyze offline analytics without impacting user experience.
- How to observe network state and react to connectivity changes.
- How to extend the framework with custom storage backends, backend adapters, and analytics providers.

Installation and Setup
Swift Package Manager (recommended)
- Add the package dependency to your project with the URL:
  https://github.com/Nahodan/iOS-Offline-First-Framework
- Choose a version range that matches your stability needs (e.g., up to next major).
- Resolve dependencies in Xcode to fetch the package.
- Import modules in your code as needed, for example:
  import OfflineFirstCore
  import OfflineFirstAnalytics
  import OfflineFirstSync

Usage Patterns
- Local Data Store: You define your domain models and configure a local store. The store is the source of truth when the device is offline.
- Synchronization: The framework exposes a SyncManager that coordinates outbound and inbound changes with your backend. It handles batching, retries, and conflict resolution.
- Conflict Resolution: You can customize resolution strategies or supply a resolver that merges two versions of an entity. Default strategies swap to a deterministic policy that fits most apps.
- Analytics: Events can be recorded offline. When network is available, the system batches and uploads analytics data to a backend analytics service.
- Network State: The framework tracks network reachability and adapts its behavior to ensure data is synced when possible without blocking the user experience.

Quick Start Guide
- Step 1: Define your domain models
  - Create lightweight, Codable primitives representing your entities.
  - Use small, focused value types for IDs, timestamps, and statuses.
- Step 2: Configure a local store
  - Choose a backing store (e.g., in-memory for tests, Core Data for production, or a custom store that conforms to the frameworkâ€™s storage protocol).
  - Map domain models to storage schemas through a dedicated adapter layer.
- Step 3: Set up a sync backend
  - Implement a backend adapter that knows how to fetch, push, and pull changes.
  - Decide on a conflict resolution policy and customize a resolver if needed.
- Step 4: Integrate analytics
  - Instrument key user actions and events.
  - Persist analytics locally during offline periods and flush when online.
- Step 5: Observe and react
  - Subscribe to sync events to update the UI or trigger background tasks.
  - Observe network state and adjust UI prompts or retry strategies.

Sample Code: Minimal Setup
Note: The exact API names may differ in your integration. This example demonstrates typical patterns.

```swift
import OfflineFirstCore
import OfflineFirstSync
import OfflineFirstAnalytics
import Combine

// Domain model
struct Task: Identifiable, Codable {
    var id: String
    var title: String
    var completed: Bool
    var updatedAt: Date
}

// Storage adapter protocol conformance
final class TaskStore: LocalStore {
    typealias Entity = Task
    // Implement storage details (CRUD, indexing, etc.)
}

// Backend adapter
final class BackendAdapter: SyncBackend {
    func fetchChanges(since: Date) -> AnyPublisher<[TaskChange], Error> { /* ... */ }
    func pushChanges(_ changes: [TaskChange]) -> AnyPublisher<Void, Error> { /* ... */ }
}

// Conflict resolver
final class TaskConflictResolver: ConflictResolver {
    func resolve(local: Task, remote: Task) -> Task {
        // Simple last-writer-wins policy
        return local.updatedAt > remote.updatedAt ? local : remote
    }
}

// Analytics
final class TaskAnalytics: AnalyticsProvider {
    func track(_ event: AnalyticsEvent) { /* store locally for later upload */ }
}

// Setup
let store = TaskStore()
let backend = BackendAdapter()
let resolver = TaskConflictResolver()
let analytics = TaskAnalytics()

let syncManager = SyncManager(
    storage: store,
    backend: backend,
    resolver: resolver,
    analytics: analytics
)

Task {
    try await syncManager.initialize()
    // Create a task
    let task = Task(id: UUID().uuidString, title: "Prepare notes", completed: false, updatedAt: Date())
    try await store.save(task)
    // Sync with backend
    try await syncManager.sync()
}
```

Note: Replace the placeholder types and methods with the actual APIs provided by the framework in your project. The example demonstrates a typical flow: define a domain entity, prepare a local store, configure a backend adapter, specify a conflict resolver, enable analytics, and drive synchronization.

Data Model and Storage
- Domain Models: Keep domain models lightweight, Codable, and independent of persistence concerns.
- Persistence: The framework supports multiple storage backends. You can choose Core Data, SQLite, or a custom store that conforms to the local storage protocol.
- Mapping: Use adapters to translate between domain models and the storage layer. This separation ensures you can evolve storage without impacting domain rules.
- Migrations: Provide a clear migration path for schema changes. The framework includes versioned migrations that apply when the app upgrades.

Sync Engine and Conflict Resolution
- Sync Phases:
  - Detect Changes: The system tracks local changes and queues them for upload.
  - Push Changes: Changes are batched and sent to the backend with a stable ordering.
  - Pull Changes: The system fetches remote changes and applies them to the local store.
  - Resolve Conflicts: When the same entity changes on multiple devices, the conflict resolver determines the final state.
- Conflict Strategies:
  - Last Writer Wins: Simple and deterministic, suitable for non-critical fields.
  - Merge Rules: Merge non-conflicting fields, apply domain-specific merge logic for complex types.
  - Custom Resolver: Provide a resolver tailored to your domain constraints.
- Conflict Audit: Each conflict is recorded with a snapshot of both sides and the chosen resolution to aid debugging.

Offline Analytics
- Local Generation: Analytics events are generated in-app during user actions, screen views, and feature usage.
- Local Buffering: Events are buffered locally to avoid network delays or user interruptions.
- Upload Strategy: Batched uploads on network reachability with exponential backoff and retry limits.
- Privacy and Security: Analytics are stored in a privacy-conscious way with opt-in controls. Personal data is minimized and encrypted when stored on device.
- Dashboards: The framework provides hooks to feed analytics into your own dashboards or to export metrics for external services.

Observability and Diagnostics
- Sync Status: Real-time status indicators for idle, syncing, or error states.
- Conflict Logs: A detailed log of conflicts, including entity IDs, timestamps, and resolver outcomes.
- Network State: The framework tracks connectivity changes and adapts retry behavior.
- Health Checks: Lightweight health checks ensure the storage and backend adapters are responsive.
- Instrumentation: The system emits events suitable for telemetry pipelines and CI dashboards.

Testing and Quality Assurance
- Unit Tests: Test domain logic, conflict resolution, and integration points with mocked backends.
- Integration Tests: Validate end-to-end syncing with a test backend environment.
- Snapshot Tests: Ensure persisted data matches expected structures after migrations or merges.
- Performance Tests: Measure sync throughput, memory usage, and latency under varying network conditions.
- Test Data: The framework includes utilities for creating deterministic test data.

Performance and Best Practices
- Batching and Throttling: The sync engine uses batching to minimize network calls and to improve handleability of large data sets.
- Conflict Minimization: Design your domain model to minimize conflicts. Favor idempotent operations and clear ownership semantics.
- Local-First UX: Offer optimistic UI updates while syncing to keep the experience smooth.
- Resource Management: Use background tasks to perform heavy sync operations when possible, with respect to iOS life cycle.
- Data Locality: Keep frequently accessed data in a fast local store and only fetch remote changes when necessary.
- Observability: Use the exposed metrics to tune your system and to identify bottlenecks.

Security and Privacy
- Data at Rest: Local data is stored securely using platform-provided protections.
- Data in Transit: All sync traffic is encrypted via TLS.
- Access Control: Core repositories support role-based access patterns for multi-user scenarios.
- Privacy Controls: Opt-in analytics are clearly separated from core data and are user-reconcilable with strict boundaries.

Roadmap
- Enhanced Conflict Scopes: More granular conflict resolution primitives for nested objects.
- Real-time Sync: Sub-second latency for changes in connected scenarios.
- Cross-Platform Sync: Desktop and web clients sharing a unified sync protocol.
- Observability Enhancements: Rich dashboards and advanced alerting.
- Tooling Suite: CLI tools for migrations, migrations previews, and data seeding for tests.
