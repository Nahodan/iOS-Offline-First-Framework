## 🔧 Development Workflow

### 1. Issue Creation
- Check existing issues before creating new ones
- Use appropriate issue templates
- Provide detailed reproduction steps
- Include device and iOS version information

### 2. Feature Development
- Create feature branch from `master`
- Implement feature with comprehensive tests
- Update documentation
- Add examples if applicable
- Ensure all tests pass

### 3. Code Review Process
- Self-review your changes
- Request review from maintainers
- Address all review comments
- Ensure CI/CD passes
- Update documentation if needed

### 4. Pull Request Guidelines
- Use descriptive PR titles
- Provide detailed descriptions
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Link related issues
- Add appropriate labels

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Unit Testing
```swift
import XCTest
@testable import OfflineFirstFramework

class OfflineFirstManagerTests: XCTestCase {
    
    var manager: OfflineFirstManager!
    
    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()
        manager = OfflineFirstManager.shared
    }
    
    override func tearDown() {
        manager = nil
        super.tearDown()
    }
    
    func testDataSynchronization() {
        // Test implementation
    }
}
```

### Integration Testing
- Test data flow between components
- Verify offline/online transitions
- Test conflict resolution scenarios
- Validate sync performance

### Performance Testing
- Measure sync operation times
- Monitor memory usage
- Test with large datasets
- Validate battery impact

## 📚 Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
```swift
/// Manages offline-first data synchronization with conflict resolution
/// and real-time network state monitoring.
///
/// This class provides a comprehensive solution for building offline-capable
/// iOS applications with automatic data synchronization when connectivity
/// is restored.
///
/// ## Usage Example
/// ```swift
/// let manager = OfflineFirstManager.shared
/// manager.initialize(with: configuration)
/// ```
///
/// - Note: This class is thread-safe and can be used across multiple threads.
/// - Important: Always call `initialize(with:)` before using other methods.
public class OfflineFirstManager {
    // Implementation
}
```

### API Documentation
- Document all public APIs
- Include usage examples
- Explain parameters and return values
- Add performance considerations
- Include error handling examples

## 🔒 Security Guidelines

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use secure network communication
- Implement proper authentication
- Validate all input data
- Follow OWASP guidelines

### Privacy Compliance
- Follow GDPR requirements
- Implement data minimization
- Provide user consent mechanisms
- Support data deletion requests
- Document privacy practices

## 🚀 Release Process

### Version Management
